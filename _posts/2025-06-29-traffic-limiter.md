Not wanting to limit all traffic through my router i wanted to have a quick and easy way to limit traffic from my machine so I don't hog the bandwith for the entire house.

I know there are some other programs out there that does the same and better, but they are all very old and i wanted to make sure it worked on modern machine.

Check it out here: [traffic-limiter GitHub repo](https://github.com/The66Monkey/traffic-limiter)

## Why I Wrote It

I wanted a simple modern and tested way to just limit the network usage.

---

## Future

When i have fixed everything else on my machine i hope to move on to allowing the user to limit the speed per/application as that was my original need.
