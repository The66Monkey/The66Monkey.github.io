Hi! I'm **The66Monkey**, a Linux tinkerer and minimalist terminal dweller.  
This blog captures my experiments with Debian, Bash scripting, and tools that streamline the CLI experience.  
I write, I script, I break stuff and learn from the debris.

I'm part of the End of 10 initiative https://endof10.org/ and in that also want to help make the user experience better for newcomers to debian.

This site is co-authored with a little help from **Copilot**, since it cut's down days of forum diving into minutes.  
I am fuled by Coffe & Hatred, and since i'm antisocial by nature a fucking LLM is at least not patronising when i get something wrong.

Check out my [GitHub projects](https://github.com/The66Monkey) to see what I’m building.  
Let’s make the terminal a little friendlier—one script at a time.
